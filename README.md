# Rainfall Prediction System
    Using Machine Learning (Python)

- ## Dataset:
  Monthly rainfall data of Indian State and UT from year 1901 to 2015.

- ## Models:
    - [ ] Linear Regression Model
    - [ ] Lasso Model
    - [ ] Ridge Model
    - [ ] SVM Model
    - [x] Random Forest Model

      > We will be using Random Forest Model for this project.

- ## Create Model:
    - Install requirements from `requirements.txt` & `dev_req.txt`
    - To create the model run `python3 src.py`

- ## Deploy Flask App:
    - Before deploying make sure that `model.pkl` is present in root directory.
    - Now deploy the flask app using `main.py`
